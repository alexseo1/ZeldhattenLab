Zeldahatten.java
Imagine that the grid of Manhattan worked like the 8-bit Zelda games. Every time you walk past the last
street or avenue, you reappear on the other end.

All code in main() method
Create the grid of Manhattan
Streets range from 1st St. to 220th St.
Avenues range from 1st Ave. to 12th Ave.
Drop Link onto the grid
Hardcode Link moving left, right, up, and down (at least one for each)
Print out every movement in a nice format (i.e. indicate to the reader the street vs. avenue, etc.)
If Link goes over the bounds of the grid --> they reappear on the other end
NO conditionals (if statements, etc.) or loops
